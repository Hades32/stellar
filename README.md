# Stellar
Simplified Container Runtime Cluster

Stellar is designed to provide simple container runtime clustering.  One
or more nodes are joined together to create a cluster.  The cluster
is eventually consistent making it ideal for transient workloads or edge
computing where nodes are not always guaranteed to have high bandwidth, low
latency connectivity.
